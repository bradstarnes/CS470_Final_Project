# CS470_Final_Project

## About Project
Our initial group idea was to work on a project that held some interest to us. All of us having a special love for our furry friends decided upon an animal shelter and tracking the relationships between the pets, workers, volunteers, customers, and donors. 
Idea
Animal Shelter Database that tracks the interactions amongst the employees, volunteers, customers, and donors. Tracking things like salaries, employee and volunteer interaction with pets, customer purchases, donations, and vendors. 


## Viewing our Project Live

You can view our project live on the web until 5/25/2020 where it will be automatically destroyed by the destroyer of all worlds since our group member shared his business server space for this. You can view our site on the web by visiting https://bradstarnes.com/cs470. 
 

## Checking it Out on GitHub

We've made our repo public so you can pull it and run it locally. https://github.com/bradstarnes/CS470_Final_Project.git

## Configuring for your Database

We've made it simple so you only have to update ONE file. 


Go to `../includes/config.ini`

Update `servername = localhost` to your servername. Some computers may require you to specify the port here. <br/>
Update `username = root` to your username <br/>
Update `password = root` to your password <br/>
Update `dbname = dbname` to your DB name
